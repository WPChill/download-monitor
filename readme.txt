Plugin with interface for uploading and managing download files, inserting download links in posts, and monitoring download hits.

== Description ==

Download Monitor is a plugin for uploading and managing downloads, tracking download hits, and displaying links.

Development for this plugin can now be found on GitHub: https://github.com/mikejolley/download-monitor

For older versions of wordpress use the older Download Monitor version 2.2.3 which is available from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/download-monitor/download/ (tested and working in Wordpress 2.0 and 2.3).

Plugin contains filetype icons from the Fugue Icon Pack by Yusuke Kamiyamane.

= Features =

*	Uses shortcodes (backward compatible with old [download#id] style).

== Installation ==

= First time installation instructions =

Installation is fast and easy. The following steps will guide get you started:

   1. Unpack the *.zip file and extract the /download-monitor/ folder and the files.
   2. Using an FTP program, upload the /download-monitor/ folder to your WordPress plugins directory (Example: /wp-content/plugins).
   3. Ensure the <code>/wp-content/uploads</code> directory exists and has correct permissions to allow the script to upload files.
   4. Open your WordPress Admin panel and go to the Plugins page. Locate the "Wordpress Download Monitor" plugin and
      click on the "Activate" link.
   5. Once activated, go to the Downloads admin section.
   
Note: If you encounter any problems when downloading files it is likely to be a file permissions issue. Change the file permissions of the download-monitor folder and contents to 755 (check with your host if your not sure how).
