== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Download Monitor" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
* Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I upload .xxx filetype using the uploader? =
